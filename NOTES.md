# DanskPrep — Development Notes

This file tracks improvement tasks, known issues, and session notes.
Check off items as they are completed. New feature branches are created per item.

## 🗂️ Feature Branch Workflow

```
main → feature/A (PR) → feature/B (PR) → feature/C ...
```
Each todo below maps to one feature branch. Branches are chained (B branches from A's merged commit)
so any feature can be rolled back by reverting its PR.

## ⚡ High Priority — No Credentials Required (Pure Code)

### 0. Writing & Speaking Test Modes
**Branch:** `feature/writing-speaking`

- Writing page: exam-style prompts, free-form textarea, AI scoring via Claude API (user provides ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in Settings)
- Speaking page: record audio, self-transcribe, AI grammar scoring
- Both need `ai-scoring.ts` utility and API key management in Settings

### 1. useProgress Refresh After Study Session
**Branch:** `feature/progress-refresh`

- `HomePage` stats (cards due, streak) go stale after returning from `StudyPage`
- Fix: expose `refresh()` from `useProgress`, pass it as a prop to `StudyPage`, call on session complete
- Or: pass `key={sessionId}` to force re-mount on return to `HomePage`

### 2. WordOrder Component — Allow Reorder
**Branch:** `feature/wordorder-ux`

Current: click word → appended; no way to fix order without clearing all.

Fix A (simple): click placed word to remove it (append back to available pool)
Fix B (proper): `@dnd-kit/core` drag-and-drop

### 3. Lazy-Load Seed JSON in Hooks
**Branch:** `feature/lazy-seed-json`

Replace static imports in hooks with dynamic imports to defer ~300 KB JSON until needed:
```typescript
// Before: static (always bundled)
import wordsData from '@/data/seed/words-pd3m2.json'

// After: dynamic (only loaded when hook is first called)
const { default: wordsData } = await import('@/data/seed/words-pd3m2.json')
```
Affects: `useStudy.ts`, `useWords.ts`, `useQuiz.ts`, `useGrammar.ts`

## 🔐 Requires Credentials

### 4. Connect Supabase
**Status:** Migrations applied, types + seeding remaining

`.env.local` configured. Supabase CLI linked. Migrations 001-008 applied via `supabase db push`.

Remaining steps:
1. ~~Apply migrations~~ ✅ Done (001-008 pushed via CLI)
2. Run `npm run types` to generate real DB types → replace `createClient<any>()` in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
3. Run `cd scripts && uv run python seed-database.py` to populate DB (needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`)

### 5. Enrich Vocabulary — Fill 143 Empty Verb Inflections
**Needs:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

143 common verbs from speakandlearn.dk have empty inflections in `words-pd3m2.json`.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
cd scripts && uv run python enrich-vocabulary.py
```

Uses `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — cheap, fast. Expected: ~$0.05 for 143 verbs.

### 6. Danish Grammar PDF → Grammar Enrichment
**Needs:** PDF download + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (for reformatting)

PDF: `https://dn790008.ca.archive.org/0/items/DanishGrammar/Danish%20Grammar.pdf`

Steps:
1. Build `scripts/scrape-grammar-pdf.py` (use `pymupdf` / `pdfminer.six`)
2. Extract text per chapter, map to 6 grammar topic slugs
3. Use Claude to format as `grammar-pd3m2.json` schema (rule_cards, tips, common_mistakes)
4. Current grammar seed is basic stubs — this would make the Grammar section genuinely useful

## 🔜 Medium Priority — Code Work

### 7. Supabase Sync Retry Queue
**Branch:** `feature/sync-retry`

If Supabase update fails during review, FSRS state is currently lost.

Fix: on failure, push to `localStorage` key `danskprep_review_queue`. On next load, flush queue first.
Queue shape: `{ card_id, rating, reviewed_at, response, was_correct, time_taken_ms }[]`

### 8. Automate Supabase Integration During Development
**Status:** Partially done — CLI linked, `/supabase-sync` skill created

- [x] **Link Supabase project**: CLI linked via `supabase link --project-ref`
- [x] **Push migrations via CLI**: `supabase db push` applies pending migrations (001-008 done)
- [x] **`/supabase-sync` skill**: auto-runs on new migration files (see `.claude/rules/supabase-workflow.md`)
- [ ] **Generate real DB types**: `npm run types` → replace `createClient<any>()`
- [ ] **CI migration check**: GitHub Actions `supabase db push --dry-run` on PRs touching migrations
- [ ] **Seed script**: `uv run python scripts/seed-database.py` (needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`)
- [ ] **Keep `apply-all-migrations.sql`**: maintained as convenience copy for SQL Editor fallback
- [ ] **Local Supabase dev** (optional): `supabase start` for local Postgres

---

### ~~10. In-App Feedback Mode~~ ✅ COMPLETED (feature/feedback-session)

---

## 📅 Low Priority / Nice-to-Have

- [ ] **ProgressPage chart** — add `recharts` bar chart of reviews per day (last 7 days)
- [ ] **useAuth — token expiry handling** — watch `SIGNED_OUT` event in `AuthGuard`
- [ ] **moduletest.dk scraper** — Google OAuth interactive login + module test extraction
- [ ] **Gyldendal modultest scraper** — needs Gyldendal credentials (see `references/gyldendal-modultest.md`)
- [ ] **PD2 / PD3M1 content** — scrape once enrolled in those courses
- [ ] **In-app SpeakSpeak sync UI** — Settings page CLI copy-paste command for local scrape

---

## ✅ Completed

### Session 2026-03-02 cont. #6 — Infrastructure & tooling (branch: feature/dashboard-drill-button)
- [x] **Supabase migrations pushed** — CLI linked, migrations 001-005 marked as applied (existed from SQL Editor), 006-008 pushed successfully
- [x] **`/supabase-sync` skill** — created skill for pushing migrations via CLI with auth check, dry-run, and repair docs
- [x] **Skills format fix** — converted all 17 skills from flat `.md` to `<name>/SKILL.md` directory format with YAML frontmatter
- [x] **Rules vs References split** — moved `danish-content`, `fsrs-rules`, `supabase-patterns`, `ui-feedback` from rules (always-loaded) to references (on-demand); updated 7 skills with reference pointers
- [x] **Nix + direnv** — created `.envrc` (`use flake`), trimmed `flake.nix` to 4 packages (nodejs_20, python312, uv, supabase-cli), added `nix-system-deps.md` rule
- [x] **`supabase-workflow.md` rule** — auto-triggers `/supabase-sync` when new migration files are created
- [x] **CLAUDE.md slimmed** — 308 → 106 lines; removed sections duplicated in rules/references; total always-loaded context reduced from 693 → 488 lines

### Session 2026-03-02 cont. #5 — PR #25 code review fixes (branch: feature/dashboard-drill-button)
- [x] **[CRITICAL] Tighten RLS policies** — `bubble_scores` insert/update policies now enforce ownership (`auth.uid()` match for signed-in, `null` user_id + `is_guest` for guests); Migration 008
- [x] **[CRITICAL] Fix timer cleanup leak** — `WordBubble.tsx` timers stored in refs with cleanup `useEffect` on unmount; removed dead `return` from `handleClick`
- [x] **WelcomeGate redirect** — navigating to `/welcome` while signed in now redirects to `/home` instead of force-signing the user out
- [x] **Browser locale detection** — default locale uses `navigator.language` (Danish browser → `da`, else → `en`) instead of hardcoded `'da'`
- [x] **Seed script error handling** — delete-then-insert for exercises/sentences wrapped in try/except with `sys.exit(1)` on failure
- [x] **Extract `useBubbleGame` hook** — deduplicated identical bubble game state from `Layout.tsx` and `WelcomePage.tsx` into `src/hooks/useBubbleGame.ts`
- [x] **Fix user object dependency** — `BubbleLeaderboard` useEffect dependency changed from `[isGuest, user]` to `[isGuest, user?.id]` to avoid re-fires on object identity changes
- [x] **Delete prototype HTML** — `prototype-welcome.html` removed; `prototype-*.html` added to `.gitignore`
- [x] **Fix pointer-events hack** — added `input`, `select`, `textarea` to pointer-events-auto list on WelcomePage content wrapper
- [x] **localStorage key prefix** — `BUBBLE_NICKNAME` and `BUBBLE_SCORES` now use `danskprep_` prefix; one-time migration in `useBubbleGame.ts` moves old keys
- [x] **Type-safe translation keys** — `Feature` interface uses `TranslationKeys` type for `titleKey`, `descKey`, `tagKey`

### Session 2026-03-02 cont. #4 (branch: feature/dashboard-drill-button)
- [x] **Bubble session redesign** — proper session model where signed-in users persist score across page loads; guests start fresh but can resume from leaderboard
- [x] **Multi-nickname DB model** — Migration 007: signed-in users can have multiple leaderboard entries (one per nickname), replacing single-row model
- [x] **Clickable leaderboard rows** — click any name on the rankings board to adopt that nickname and resume its score
- [x] **Guest nickname resume** — guests can type or click an old nickname to resume accumulated score from localStorage/Supabase
- [x] **Signed-in session restore** — on page refresh/navigation, signed-in user's nickname + score loaded from Supabase (most recent entry)
- [x] **onScoreLoad architecture** — score restoration flows from BubbleLeaderboard → GamePanel → Layout/WelcomePage; race-condition guard lives in BubbleLeaderboard (not parent)
- [x] **Welcome page auth links** — Sign In / Sign Up buttons added to WelcomeTopBar
- [x] **Seed script fix** — exercises and sentences use delete-then-insert (no natural unique key); `acceptable_answers` null handling; error handling on insert failure
- [x] **Combined migration file** — `apply-all-migrations.sql` updated to include 006 + 007 + 008 (tightened RLS)
- [x] **Comprehensive tests** — 35 tests covering pure functions (getLocalScores, saveLocalScore), component rendering, shuffle, row-click resume, post-refresh resume, nickname persistence, and session lifecycle

### Session 2026-03-02 cont. #3 (branch: feature/dashboard-drill-button)
- [x] **Bubble Word Game** — floating Danish word bubbles with click-to-discover, auto-rising animation, configurable per context (welcome ON, app OFF)
- [x] **Game Leaderboard** — nickname-based rankings with localStorage primary + Supabase optional sync
- [x] **Guest vs signed-in scoring** — guest shuffle resets score (one nickname per try); signed-in accumulates across nicknames with history tracking
- [x] **Auto-sync scores** — removed submit button; localStorage immediate + Supabase debounced (3s); handles high traffic via upsert pattern
- [x] **Trophy badge** — hanging trophy icon below game icon in header; opens rankings side panel
- [x] **GamePanel inline** — rankings panel squeezes page content instead of overlapping
- [x] **Migration 006** — `bubble_scores` + `bubble_nickname_history` tables with RLS and conditional unique indexes
- [x] **Documentation** — `docs/games.md` with architecture, data flow diagrams, and future game ideas

### Session 2026-03-02 cont. #2 (branch: feature/feedback-session)
- [x] **Support redesign** — renamed "Donate" to "Support" with Coffee icon (pink), removed MobilePay `<a href>` link (security), hardcoded number as JS constant, Vercel Analytics `support_click` event
- [x] **Dictionary inflections** — `api/dictionary.ts` now extracts gender, normalizes POS (Danish→English), builds structured inflections from DDO suffixes
- [x] **User words schema** — `src/lib/user-words.ts` aligned with `Word` type (gender, inflections, examples, difficulty)
- [x] **Supabase graceful null** — `supabase.ts` exports `null` when env vars missing; all consumers guard against it
- [x] **user_words migration** — `005_add_user_words.sql` with RLS (private per user)
- [x] **Feature flag** — `FEATURES.DICT_ADD_TO_VOCAB = false` to disable WIP add-to-vocabulary
- [x] **Sidebar polish** — GitHub link moved above "Built by", version number beside it
- [x] **i18n translations** — `en.ts` + `da.ts` with support.* and dictionary.* keys
- [x] **useWords merge** — seed + user-added words merged with Supabase sync + deduplication

### Session 2026-03-02 cont. (branch: feature/feedback-session)

## Known Issues

- **143 verbs with empty inflections** — form-test questions will be skipped for these; run `enrich-vocabulary.py` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **WordOrder UX** — no way to reorder placed words without clearing all; click-to-remove or drag-and-drop needed
- **HomePage stats go stale** — `useProgress` doesn't refresh after returning from Study; needs refresh mechanism
- **Scrapers need manual review** — search output JSON for `"REVIEW"` and fill in missing answers
- **`npm run types`** — must be run after Supabase is connected to get real DB types
- **Writing & Speaking modes** — need ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for AI scoring; see Step 0 in High Priority
- **Listening exercises** — need SpeakSpeak scraper update to capture audio files
